Can I get an mp4 on here?

I've been doing a tiny bit of photographic journalism (if I can call it that) in an effort to capture the emotions & situations of the pandemic. Here are my better shots:

I think this image nicely captures the atmosphere at Webb on the last day of in-person classes - our iconic light-hearted class sweatshirt hanging hopelessly, baby blue against a bleak gray sky, abandoned to sop wet in the face of forces we couldn't begin to control.

A few blocks away, the Pitzer College students were outright angry. What better way to express your angst than with a can of spray paint? At least this time it's not a war.

Yet, just outside my front door, glimmers of hope in the pastel pinks and oranges of the setting sun. When we see fictional accounts of global emergencies, time seems to grind to a halt. But - well, life goes on.
