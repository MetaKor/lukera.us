## Welcome to the official website of Luke Raus

Maybe I'll get around to making this a legit website at some point... but until then, here are a handful of cool links that have accumulated in my bookmarks folders. I figure I spend too much time browsing the web to not compile some of my favorites. More things to possibly come. Enjoy!
