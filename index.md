## Hi! Nice to meet you.

I'm Luke Raus, a recent graduate of the Webb Schools and current first year at Olin College of Engineering.

My pursuits are driven by an intense curiosity about the world around me, and I've had the opportunity to try my hand in many arenas: neural networks, CNC machining, organic chemistry, generative art, and ethics & philosophy to name a few. I'm still figuring out what I want to do in life, but whatever it is, I can guarantee it won't be straightforward or one-dimensional; I thrive in the overlaps and intersections.

#### This site is very much under construction...
so don't hesitate to bookmark me and check back in a while ;)
